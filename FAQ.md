## Section 1

### Which task from section 1 is relatable to back-end tasks? Is it 1A - Sorting problem?
A: Yes, 1A is considered a back-end task.

## Section 2

## Section 3
### 3A. task mentioned that "gets data from a product API". So, should my code call the api `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exove/developer-test/main/material/products.json` and extract only the products array property from the response object to save into SQL DB?
A: Yes, the json file mocks the response from an hypothetical product API, and you have to store the items found in the products array.

### 3B. I was wondering if it is allowed in the React-task 3B to use CSS tools like Tailwind?
A: Yes, for styling the application in the React tasks you can choose to use whatever libraries you see fit :)

### 3B. What is exactly meant with this part “Browse multiple comics/images from the top level”?
A: The idea with that is that in the task 2A you're only required to be able to browse the pages/images of a single comic and on 3B you should expand that concept to being able to first select one comic from multiple options that you want to open "from the top level" and then browse its pages. Or if you're making an image browser you could think of it kind of like a folder structure where on the top level you have folders and when you open one you see the contents.
